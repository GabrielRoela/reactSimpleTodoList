# Simple React Todo list

A simple Todo/Task manager app built with React

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML*, CSS, JavaScript, JSX, React, Json-server, React router

A simple project built to work with the simple concepts of react and to visit the changes from orignal documentations into the new and improved conventions of the React library.

## Optimizations

Next step on the front side is to make it more responsive so it looks better in smaller screens.
And on the production side, to add user authentication to make this deploayble as a Webapp

## Lessons Learned:

All of the react basics are in this project: From switching to function based components (from the old class based components), to handling state, react router (and all the differences it brought with the newest v6 update), the use of Json-Server to simulate an API with local data, and small auxiliary packages like React icons.
